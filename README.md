# do-i-own-it

Web application for tracking owned physical media.

### API
Source for the API can be found within the `api` folder.

### UI
Source for the UI can be found within the `ui` folder. _Note: no code written for UI yet._

### Running the application
Ideally, once the application is in an alpha state, you will be able to run the API and UI via two methods:
- Utilizing their respective Docker images
- Cloning the source code and setting up the environment yourself
